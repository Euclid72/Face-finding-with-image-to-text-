# Face-finding-with-image-to-text-

This program uses Tesseract, OpenCV, and Pillow libraries to text dection on images, face detection, and image manipulation respectively. Supplied images are firstly scaned by Teserract library and the texts that image contains gets extracted. Then we get a phrase or word to search on these texts that we just extracted. Then program gathers the images that contains the keyword that we're searching on their corresponding texts. Then program uses OpenCV face detection with pretrained machine learning model(supplied by Michigan University Online Course) to gather faces. Then lastly we display these faces with Pil image manipulation techniques.
 
This project is just for fun and has no real purpose. :(
